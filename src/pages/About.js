      <p>Functional Component: Ensure that the component where you're using useState is a functional component and not a class component. Hooks can only be used in functional components or other custom hooks.
Import React: Make sure you're importing React in your component file. Even if you're not explicitly using it, it's necessary for JSX transformation and hook functionality.
Initialization: Double-check that you're not trying to access useState before it's initialized. It should be called directly inside the functional component body, not conditionally or inside nested functions.
Multiple React Versions: If you're using multiple versions of React in your project, it could cause conflicts. Make sure you're consistently using the same version throughout your project.</p>
